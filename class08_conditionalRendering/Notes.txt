***************Conditional-rendering*******************
All the typescript functions are not supported in the react function means in return html of react react component 
There are only limited functions that are supported
We can write any kind of  typescript above the return (//html code).

************Types of typescript that is used in the return html code******************
1- We can print any typescript variable using { }
2- Conditional operator
3-And operator (same as Conditional operator but not include else statement)
example of Conditional operator :

{props.showTag ? <Tag title="web" /> : "No tags available"}
                 OR
{count>5? <span className='text-black'>{count}</span>: null }  
                 OR
<div style={{backgroundColor: props.isDescription? 'yellow' : 'white'}} className="h-auto w-[23rem] rounded  shadow-lg bg-white">


Conditional operator is useful for the multiple or single page applications like we can 
show and hide navbar or footer etc from some pages of website
