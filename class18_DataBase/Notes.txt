******************File-management-system****************

=> In the past , the data is stored in the file system => file.txt
=> File system is a way of organizing and storing files on a computer
=> This system is very slow.
=> The data fetch is very complicated and takes a lots of time.

***************DataBase****************
=> The solution of slow data fetching problem is database.
=> Database is a collection of organized data that is stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation.
=> Database is a software system that allows you to define, create, maintain, and manipulate databases.
=> Every database stores the data in the file system but they have specific extensions to store data in file system to get get data in the fastest way 
=> Every software makes its own extension like .ppt / .word / .psql to store data in a fastest way.
=> In Short Database is used to make queries to retrieve the data in a short time.
=> IT is much more faster then file system.
=> We can read , delete , update data from database through server for security purpose.




Note: 
=> The data always store in the form of files in the hard drive(computer)
