*****************Components-based-engineering********************

Every thing that is repeated in a website must be a component that is reuseable.

=> In a multiple page application: We make the pages at the root level like making the sub-trees of the main page of website,
then we make the Components in that pages that are reuseable in the code. we do not make the rout files (page.tsx or rout.ts) in Components folder

Props: 
=> in a simple functions we pass the parameters but in the .tsx (react) function , we pass the props
