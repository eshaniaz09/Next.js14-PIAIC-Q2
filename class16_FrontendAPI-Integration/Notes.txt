*******************Frontend-API-Integration**********************
It is a simple frontend application that integrates with a backend API to fetch and display data.
The application is built using Next.js and uses Axios for making API requests.
The API used in this application is a simple RESTful API that provides data in JSON format.

=> How frontend development communicate with backend development:
   * Fronted development gives requests to backend
    Through api => REST api {The apis that give response in json formate are called rest api}
                => Graphql api
                => Socket (real time communication) : used for live connection means the requests and response time is very less like live steaming etc
=> They communicate Through http protocol


=> In order to connect the backend with frontend development ,the frontend developer wants to know the api used in backend and documentation of backend development
=> There are many tools in market that writes the documentation of backend and gives to frontend for Integration like:
                => Postman (Most popular)            
                => Swagger (Most popular)            


Example to call the data  from random api: rest.api in page.tsx of next.js

  const getTodo = async () => {
    try {
      const Result = await axios.get('https://dummyjson.com/todos')
      console.log(`Data from rest api:`, Result.data.todos);
      
    } catch (error) {

      console.log(`Data not found! Error: ${error} `);
      
      
    }
  }















Note: 
=> API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface 
can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.
=> The apis that give response in json formate are called rest api
