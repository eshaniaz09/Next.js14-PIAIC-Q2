***************Props-Next.js-14***************
Props are used when we are using the Components and want to display the components 
with some changes in different pages

How to make props:
=>Data ts always send from parent to child in a props
=> Data is passed from where it is called like:
              <Button title="Apply" />
here : title is the prop name, we can pass unlimited props in a react function call              

=>Now in the react function definition, there will be only parameter => props

type buttonType = {
    title: string
}

How to run the typescript code in html => { }


function Button(props: buttonType){
    console.log(`props = ${props.title});
    return(
        <button>{props.tittle}</button>
    )
}

we can also define the types of the props in separate folder => app/types/componentTypes.ts


props can be nested
