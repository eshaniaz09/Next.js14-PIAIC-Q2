l********************Import and Export***********************

=> two types of import and export:
The code we import from the other developer through node module by " npm i " is saved 
in node_modules folder and  we can  import it  as:

import React from "react";

but when we use ./ or @ in import code then its mean we import code from own own file or folder created.
like: 
import Image from "next/image";

if the code is simply exported then we imported with { } and if the code is default exported the we don't use { } , we import with name only 
import { React} from "react";
import React from "react";


examples:
export var a: number = 39;
import { a } from './test'
        OR
var a = 39;
export default a;
import esha from './test'

All the css files must be import in layout.tsx as 

import './style.css'




******************** React Component******************

Single page application: returns only one html file
multiple page application: returns multiple html files depends on the number of pages
react only support Single page application
next js support multiple page application is best for SEO 

=> In order to make multiple pages => in different folders we must make page.tsx file

Code in page.tsx: 
Requirements:
1-Make a function that returns html and css and this function is called react Component (make the function name start with capital letter)
2-export default function

note: all the tags of the html in r=next.js must be closed


***Babel and webpack**** used to compile .tsx file by making separate files of html , css and ts (browser do not understand .tsx file directly) 

*******How to Link multiple pages********
