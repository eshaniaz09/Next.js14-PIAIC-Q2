**************Two types of server******************
Server applications : software application :We request the server application whenever we want our code , return it to me 
The main job of application server is to accept , understand or respond to the requests of clients. 
Hardware server : when we write a code in html and css we upload it in server

React is the client framework , used for only front end development (html,css and ts, react , angular , view.js : all are browser application it is not have any impact on server)
Next.js is the server application ,it is also used in backend development
we also call it as : next.js server, node.js server, python flask server, python django server , php server


There are some servers that are pre-built-in like : Nginx or apache or netlify or surge
Nginx sever have the ability to perform the job to receive  requests of client , process and respond to clients , we have to just
download Nginx and place our html, css files in it's public folder.
But Nginx have some specific jobs

***************Request Respond Workings*************
HTTP protocol jobs:  send request from client to server and respond to client.
only one method used in HTTP protocol in browser : get()

Example: 
// request sending.........
GET(): request
                      http://129:213:131:12 : 3000 / WordPdfCreate
 here : http is protocol ,  129:213:131:12 is the ip address of the server where request in gone, 3000 is the port number of the server application , / pdfCreate is the rout that contains some logic(which is the request)
// respond to request.........
Nginx: server application 
There is the port number of every application.
Server application also need the port number  like : 3000 , already used port numbers are not used again

***********Domain name system******************
It is difficult for humans to understand the port number and ip addresses 
Here :
129:213:131:12 : 3000 => techloset.com/ here "/" is the by-default forward slash rout (main page,home page,app/page.tsx page)
329:451:161:65 : 3000 => facebook.com/contact  => here contact is the rout (rout have segments means making sub-routs, app/contact/page.tsx)

postman is the software that gives the actual respond to the requests (returns the html code or custom language code) , it dose not render the page 
browser can also render the page and respond too the requests 

we can deploy a website using netlify and surge for free....
