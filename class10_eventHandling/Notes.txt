***************Event Handling**************

When we click a button , something happens/change is called events

All the Event handling functions are not used in server
When we make components or pages , they are render by-default in the server side
When we use the onClick handle , we cannot render it on server side, we have have to render
it on the client side

=> onClick is the client component

*********How to render onClick event handler on the client side********
we write on the top of the page:
"use client"

use client means that all the html created in that page is not in the server side, but it 
is created in the browser (client side)

************Next.js Server Component****************

=>When the next.js page or component is server , then it is the html tags are printed in the browser are made by the server or we can say comes from server side.

************Next.js Client component***************

=> But when the next.js page or component is client component using "use client" code , then is not html tags, they are ts and js code that comes in the browser,
it is the browser responsibility to convert it into html tags and render or print them in browser


************Disadvantage of rendering client side**************
=> It effects the seo of the component or page.
=> It is the limitation of the next.js that we cannot render component having onClick handler on server side.
